PreventWakeup - for Linux

A brute-force approach for laptops that won't stay asleep!

Version: 0.1


This python script is a nasty hack, and I'm not proud of having to resort to writing it.

Nonetheless, if you have a laptop like mine, that for reasons unknown will spontaneously awake from sleep at random intervals - this might help.

It does the following:
 * Ensure no device triggers are configured that might wake up your PC (USB, WoL, lid open, etc)
 * Checks there are no Real Time Clock wake-ups scheduled, and logs them if there are
 * Monitors/logs X idle time (just for troubleshooting purposes at this stage)
 * Forces the computer back to sleep if the lid is closed and AC Power unplugged
 * Logs all activity to a rolling log file

It depends on the following commands being available on your system, that you may need to install via your distro's package management:
 - pm-suspend (to force suspend)
 - xprintidle (to monitor X idle time)
 - acpi (To check state of AC vs battery)

It was written for a Linux Mint system, so will likely work with other Ubuntu/Debian based distros.
